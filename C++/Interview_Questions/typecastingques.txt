1. Which of the following is an implicit type conversion?

A. int x = 3.5;
B. int x = (int)3.5;
C. double y = static_cast<double>(5);
D. float z = (float)7;
✔ Answer: A (automatic conversion from double → int)

2. What is explicit type casting also called in C++?

A. Implicit conversion
B. Type promotion
C. Type coercion
D. Type casting
✔ Answer: D

3. Which C++ cast operator is type-safe?

A. C-style cast (int)x
B. static_cast<int>(x)
C. reinterpret_cast<int>(x)
D. (int)x
✔ Answer: B

4. What happens when a double is assigned to an int?

A. Compiler error
B. Fractional part is truncated
C. Rounds to nearest integer
D. Stored as 0
✔ Answer: B

5. Which of the following correctly converts an int to a float?

A. float f = 5;
B. float f = (float)5;
C. float f = static_cast<float>(5);
D. All of the above
✔ Answer: D

6. Which type of conversion happens automatically when smaller type is assigned to larger type?

A. Type casting
B. Implicit conversion / Promotion
C. Explicit conversion
D. Narrowing conversion
✔ Answer: B

7. What is the result of this code?
int a = 10;
double b = a / 4;
cout << b;


A. 2.5
B. 2
C. 0
D. 4
✔ Answer: B (integer division happens first → 10/4 = 2 → converted to double → 2.0)

✔ Answer: B

9. Which cast removes constness from a variable?

A. static_cast
B. const_cast
C. dynamic_cast
D. reinterpret_cast
✔ Answer: B

10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type conversion?

A. Implicit requires ()
B. Explicit happens automatically
C. Implicit happens automatically, explicit requires casting operator
D. Both are the same
✔ Answer: C

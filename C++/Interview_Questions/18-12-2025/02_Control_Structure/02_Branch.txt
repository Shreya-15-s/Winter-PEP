Topic: Branching Statements

Q1. How does break behave in nested loops? Provide an example to exit outer loop from inner loop.
A1. Break only exits current loop. To exit outer, use a flag or goto. Example:
for(int i=0;i<5;i++){ for(int j=0;j<5;j++){ if(j==3){goto end;} } } end:

Q2. Explain continue in nested loops. How to skip only the inner loop iteration?
A2. Continue affects innermost loop. Example: inner for loop continues to next iteration without affecting outer loop.

Q3. How does return inside a loop differ from break?
A3. Return exits the entire function, stopping all loops; break exits only the current loop.

Q4. Can break be used in switch inside a loop? Explain with example.
A4. Yes, break exits switch, not the loop. To exit loop, use return or flag.

Q5. What are scenarios where goto improves code readability in branching?
A5. Rarely, for exiting multiple nested loops cleanly; but should be avoided if possible.

Q6. How can exceptions replace branch statements in modern C++?
A6. Use try-catch instead of multiple return statements or nested conditionals for error handling.

Q7. Explain the difference between break, continue, and return in nested loops.
A7. Break exits current loop; continue skips current iteration; return exits function entirely.

Q8. How does switch-case fall-through work and why might it be deliberately used?
A8. Cases execute sequentially if break is missing; can combine multiple cases with same logic.

Q9. Can you implement loop exit without using break or return? Example.
A9. Use loop condition variables. Example: bool done=false; while(!done){ if(cond) done=true; }

Q10. How do you handle multiple exit points in a function with loops to maintain clarity?
A10. Use flags, well-named functions, or exceptions for structured exits.

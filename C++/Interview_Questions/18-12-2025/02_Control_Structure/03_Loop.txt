Topic: Loops

Q1. Explain the difference between for, while, and do-while with real-world use case.
A1. for: fixed iterations (array traversal), while: condition-driven (input validation), do-while: at least once (menu-driven).

Q2. How would you detect and prevent infinite loops in user programs?
A2. Ensure loop conditions eventually become false, use counters, or add safety checks.

Q3. Explain nested loops with example complexity analysis.
A3. for(i=0;i<n;i++){ for(j=0;j<m;j++){ /*code*/ } } → O(n*m)

Q4. How to modify a loop dynamically based on input inside the loop?
A4. Adjust loop variable or condition inside loop body.

Q5. How to exit multiple nested loops efficiently?
A5. Use flag variables or goto to labeled statement.

Q6. Can you have loops without increment/decrement statements? Example.
A6. Yes, e.g., for(;;){/* infinite loop */} or while(condition){ modify variable inside body }

Q7. How to skip specific iterations dynamically in a loop?
A7. Use continue with conditional checks.

Q8. Explain how to use loops to process multidimensional arrays.
A8. Nested loops: outer loop for rows, inner loop for columns.

Q9. How does modifying loop variable inside the loop body affect execution? Give example.
A9. Can cause skipping or extra iterations. Example: for(int i=0;i<10;i++){ i++; }

Q10. How to choose between recursion and loops for iterative problems?
A10. Use loops for predictable iteration, recursion for tree/graph traversal or when natural recursion exists; consider stack usage.

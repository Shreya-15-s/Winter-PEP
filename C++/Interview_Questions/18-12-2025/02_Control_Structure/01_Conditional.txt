Topic: Conditional Statements

Q1. Explain the difference between nested if-else and switch-case. When would you use each?
A1. Nested if-else handles ranges and complex conditions; switch is efficient for single variable equality checks.

Q2. What are potential pitfalls of using multiple else-if statements without a final else?
A2. Missing final else may leave unhandled cases; can cause logical errors.

Q3. How can conditional operator (?:) be used in place of if-else? Give an example with nested ternary.
A3. Example: int max = (a>b) ? ((a>c)?a:c) : ((b>c)?b:c);

Q4. How does short-circuit evaluation affect conditional statements with side effects?
A4. If the first condition determines result, the second is skipped, which can avoid runtime errors or skip important operations.

Q5. Can switch statements handle ranges (e.g., 1–10)? If not, how to implement it efficiently?
A5. No, switch handles discrete values only; use if-else with ranges or map ranges to discrete case labels.

Q6. What happens if break is missing in a switch? Provide a scenario where fall-through is useful.
A6. Execution falls through to next case. Useful for grouping multiple cases with same behavior.

Q7. How can you implement a menu-driven program efficiently using switch-case and loops?
A7. Use a while loop to repeat menu and switch-case for option handling, break to exit loop.

Q8. Can conditional operator ?: be nested multiple levels? What are readability concerns?
A8. Yes, but readability decreases with deep nesting; prefer if-else for clarity.

Q9. How would you check multiple conditions with AND, OR, and NOT in a single if statement without ambiguity?
A9. Use parentheses to group expressions; example: if((a>0 && b>0) || c==10)

Q10. How can you handle invalid input gracefully in nested conditionals for console programs?
A10. Check input validity at each stage, provide default actions or error messages.
